# Setup

This section documents your practical work in week 2.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.

  # Setup

  This section contains documentation on the practical work I carried out in week 2.

  How my environment configuration was setup will be covered as well as my reflection on the work of the week.

  ## Environment Configuration

  <ins>**Shared Team Repo Setup**<ins>
  
  The first task that was undertaken this week as a team was for us to create a shared repository on GitHub and get everyone added as a contributor to the repository.

  ||:--:|| <b>Fig.1 - Team Repository Screenshot</b> |

  To achieve this outcome, one of our team members who was more experienced with GitHub created the repository, the rest of us then shared our account emails with this member and he added us to the repository as contributors.

  After this we all had access to our new shared team repository as seen in Fig.1.

  <ins>**Project and Task Board Setup**<ins>
  
  Next we were to setup a project on GitHub with an integrated task board, this again was handled by a few of the team members who were more experienced with GitHub, which at this time does not include myself as this is all completely new to me but I'd like to think I'm learning fairly quickly.

  This task board can be seen set up in a project in Fig.2 above.

  <ins>**Personal Visual Studio Setup**<ins>

  Now onto a more individually based task, I had to configure a personal copy of Visual Studio appropriately to be used for the team's work over the next few weeks.

  ![VS Configuration Screenshot](https://github.com/Darmit2003/SE_Portfolio/blob/main/images/vsConfiguration.png) 
  ||:--:|| <b>Fig.3 - VS Configuration Screenshot</b> |

  I already had a copy of Visual Studio 2019 Community but I thought it would be best to stay up to date with the latest software, so I installed a copy of Visual Studio 2022 Community to use that instead.

  When choosing the packages to install with Visual Studio I made sure to include the package which lets you build using .NET MAUI as this will be needed for future work, this can be seen in Fig.3.

  After installing this my personal copy of Visual Studio was configured appropriately and ready to use.

  <ins>**Cloning the Shared Repository**<ins>

  The last task this week linked to my team was to clone the shared team repository in Visual Studio.

  ![VS Configuration Screenshot](https://github.com/Darmit2003/SE_Portfolio/blob/main/images/vsConfiguration.png) 
  ||:--:|| <b>Image 3 - VS Configuration Screenshot</b> |

  Upon starting up Visual Studio one of the options you are presented with is to clone a repository, if you select this option you will be met with the screen shown in image 4.

  From here I linked Visual Studio to my GitHub account which allowed me to then select the team repository and clone it, meaning I was then able to make changes to files on the repository in VS and then commit the changes to GitHub.
